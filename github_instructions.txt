# GitHub Upload Instructions

After creating your GitHub repository, run the following commands to push your code:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/resume-builder.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

If you're using main as your default branch instead of master, use:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Additional GitHub Setup

To deploy the frontend to GitHub Pages:

1. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Pages
2. Select the branch you want to deploy (main or master)

4. Click Save

### Adding GitHub Actions (Optional)
To set up continuous integration:

1. In your GitHub repository, go to Actions
2. Choose a workflow template (Node.js for frontend, Python for backend)
3. Customize the workflow file as needed

### Protecting Your Main Branch (Optional)
